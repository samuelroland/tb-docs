# Just greet me
A simple hello program that asks your firstname and lastname and greets you.

Here is a test scenario when typing `John` and `Doe` manually, run your executable `main`
```
> ./main
What is your firstname ?
John
Hello John, what's your lastname ?
Doe
Have a nice day John Doe !
>
```

Check that your program has finished with the exit code 0 by running this command
```sh
echo $?
0
```

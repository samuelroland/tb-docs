==== Just greet me
A simple program that greets you with your fullname.

Make sure you have the same output as is in this scenario, with typing `John` and `Doe` manually
```
> ./main
What is your firstname ?
John
Hello John, what's your lastname ?
Doe
Have a nice day John Doe !
>
```

Start with the following code
```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // ???
}
```

Check that your program has finished with the exit code 0 by running this command
```sh
> echo $?
0
```
